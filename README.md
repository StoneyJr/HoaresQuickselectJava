# Hoare's Quickselect Algorithm implementation

This is a semester project at the Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH). The task was to implement
this algorithm, test it, write extensive JavaDoc, analyze the running time and write a report on it.

For further information on the code please read the javadoc, and for further information on the 
project/result I have provided my report and an Excel-file with runtime data/graphs.
